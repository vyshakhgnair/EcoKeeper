The smart bin is designed with two compartments, one for biodegradable waste and one for non-biodegradable waste. It utilizes sensors or cameras to detect the type and fill level of waste in each compartment. The smart bin is connected to a network and sends notifications to an administrator when a compartment is nearing full capacity.
